# Practical 10
Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject? What did you learn from doing the estimates?
Over the duration of the topic, I became more accurate in my estimations for practical activities. 
Because I had little programming expertise and overestimated some projects' complexity, I initially found it difficult to estimate the time needed for tasks effectively. 
But as I learned more about the subject and accumulated expertise, my estimations become more accurate.
I discovered how important it is to divide jobs into smaller parts and account for unforeseen difficulties or barriers when completing the estimations. I now have a greater awareness of my abilities and the amount of work needed for various projects because to this exercise.

Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
I learned a lot about code reviews from both doing reviews myself and from being reviewed.
After my code was examined, I got helpful criticism on readability, efficiency, and best practices compliance, among other things. 
These evaluations inspired me to improve my coding abilities and assisted me in identifying my shortcomings. However, I was able to examine various strategies and pick up tips from others by looking at their code. It also strengthened my comprehension of coding fundamentals and gave me the ability to offer insightful criticism. 
All things considered, the code review procedure helped to create a cooperative learning atmosphere and enhanced my ability to produce clear, maintainable code.


Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

In terms of the general practical tasks, I would think about implementing a few modifications if I were in charge of the topic. 
First, in order to help students better comprehend how the concepts they learn may be used in real-world situations, I would provide more concrete examples. Second, in order to foster student collaboration and information exchange, I would support additional group activities or pair programming sessions. Thirdly, in order to give students practical experience and strengthen their learning, I would include additional interactive coding tasks or exercises. Furthermore, I would investigate the feasibility of integrating cutting-edge technology or tools pertinent to the sector to guarantee that students are adequately equipped for the workforce. 
Ultimately, I would like to create a learning environment that is both interesting and useful to the workplace by balancing academic understanding with real-world application.

Next, add the heading, # Code Reviews.
Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

This was the Prac 3 submission which I scored 4/4 the first time.

This was the Prac 8 which we just start learning how to make Kivy app, quite challenging for us.
